A simple calculator that takes a mathematical expression as input
and returns the result.

Supported operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- True Division (/)
- Floor Division (//)
- Exponentiation (^ or **)
- Modulus (%)
- Square root (sqrt) <sup>1</sup>
- Natural logarithm (base e) (ln) <sup>1</sup>
- Common logarithm (base 10) (log) <sup>1</sup>
- Factorial (fact) <sup>1</sup> <sup>2</sup>
- Absolute value (abs) <sup>1</sup>

Other features:
- Multiple levels of round parentheses are supported ( (...(...)...) ).
- To use e or pi simply type "e" or "pi". (e.g. 2pi = 6,2831...).
- Results are displayed with thousands-separators and commas, specific
  to the users location.
- Click on list items to add them to the entry field.
- Double click on list items to overwrite the entry field.


<sup>1</sup> These operations are written with the number in parentheses. eg:  
sqrt(4) = 2; log(10^2) = 2; fact(sqrt(25)) = 120; abs(-10)**3 = 1000  

<sup>2</sup> fact only supports positive integers.
